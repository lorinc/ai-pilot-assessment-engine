### Phase 1: Rapid Knowledge Integration and Graph Definition (Day 1)
Since the core building blocks (taxonomies) are already available in the sources, the first step is to integrate them quickly into a structured format that allows for querying relationships (the graph structure).
#### 1. Define Core Nodes and Edges
The project should focus on structuring the following three core dimensions into nodes:
* **Problem Context (High-Level):** Use the `Business_Function` taxonomy (e.g., Marketing, HR, IT Operations). This serves as the initial filtering layer for the user journey.
* **Pain Points / Opportunities (Mid-Level):** Use the `AutomationOpportunities` taxonomy (e.g., "Financial Transaction Processing," "Automated FAQ Chatbots"). This dimension identifies the specific operational gaps.
* **Solution Archetypes (Low-Level):** Use the `AI_Use_Case_Archetypes` taxonomy (e.g., Classification, RAG, Anomaly Detection). This represents the technical solution space.
The crucial edges (relationships) are already defined in the `automation_opportunity_taxonomy.txt` via the `key_archetypes` attribute, linking specific pain points to probable solutions (e.g., "Multi-level Approval Workflow Automation" links to "Optimization & Scheduling" and "Agentic Orchestration").
#### 2. Incorporate Feasibility Constraints
For a few-days project, avoid complex ML model development. Instead, integrate the **Dependency Taxonomy** to create a crucial feasibility layer, addressing the requirement to consider organizational capabilities.
* **Feasibility Layer:** Append the `AI_Implementation_Prerequisites` (Data Quality, Technical Expertise, Infrastructure, etc.) as attributes or linked dependency nodes to the `AI_Use_Case_Archetype` nodes.
* *Example:* The **Classification** archetype requires **Labeled training data** and may depend on a **Feature Store**. This allows the KG to automatically list the prerequisites needed if a solution is selected.
### Phase 2: Prioritize Low-Dependency Prototyping (Day 2-3)
Given the time constraints, the project should focus on proving the value proposition of the KG using use cases that rely on readily available models or pre-trained assets, minimizing the need for heavy data labeling, GPU compute, or MLOps expertise.
#### 1. Focus on Retrieval and Generation Archetypes
These archetypes often leverage **Pre-trained models or APIs** or **Third-party LLM services**, making them feasible for rapid prototyping in a solo project, especially when using **Open-source frameworks and libraries**.
* **Information Retrieval / RAG**: Highly relevant for automating knowledge management, such as Intelligent Document Processing or Competitive Intelligence Gathering. This task relies on vector database infrastructure and semantic search, but the underlying models (LLMs with RAG) can be accessed via APIs.
* **Language & Sequence Generation**: Suitable for prototyping tasks like **Generative Content & Proposal Drafting** or **IT & Operational Documentation Creation**. These tasks utilize models like Transformer architectures (GPT, T5, Claude, Gemini), which are usually accessed as external resources.
* **Content Analysis / Labeling / Evaluation**: Used extensively across business functions (e.g., Customer Feedback, Resume Screening, Financial Forecasting). This often utilizes **Sentiment analysis models** or **Text classification** which can be implemented quickly using pre-trained components.
#### 2. Prototype Agentic Workflows
**Agentic Orchestration** is a powerful meta-archetype used across numerous opportunities (e.g., Workflow Automation, Financial Processing, Compliance). Prototyping this concept can be done using frameworks like **LangChain** or **Toolformer**, focusing on coordinating existing (mocked or simple API) tools rather than developing new heavy-duty models.
### Phase 3: Validation and Output Framework (Day 4)
The final hours should be dedicated to validating the framework's coherence and ensuring it successfully bridges the gap described in the sources.
#### 1. Validate Coherence and Consistency
Ensure that the **coherency and balanced nature of the taxonomies** is maintained, as this is more important than depth for a basic functional tool. Check for clear alignment:
* Does every high-level business function (e.g., Sales) link to relevant automation opportunities (e.g., Lead Scoring)?
* Do the suggested `key_archetypes` align logically with the technical family and core task (e.g., is "Anomaly Detection" correctly linked to tasks like Fraud Detection)?
#### 2. Develop a Minimal User Journey Prototype
Create a basic output structure that fulfills the KG's purpose: **guiding the user to narrow down the problem context** and **matching feasible solutions**.
The process flow should look like this in the prototype:
1. **User Input:** Selects a Business Function (e.g., Finance & Compliance).
2. **KG Output:** Lists associated Pain Points/Opportunities (e.g., Financial Transaction Processing).
3. **User Selection:** Selects a Pain Point (e.g., 3-Way Matching Discrepancy Resolution).
4. **KG Output (Solution):** Displays the matched key archetypes (Anomaly & Outlier Detection, Multi-hop Reasoning / Chain-of-Thought).
5. **KG Output (Feasibility Check):** For the selected archetypes, retrieve and list the necessary **Data Quality** (e.g., Clean and validated data, Transactional data), **Technical Expertise** (e.g., Software Engineers for integration), and **Infrastructure** (e.g., Real-time inference infrastructure) required for implementation.
By focusing purely on structuring and linking the provided knowledge base, the project can deliver a solid, comprehensible KG framework within a few days without incurring the heavy data, compute, and expertise dependencies associated with training complex machine learning models.
