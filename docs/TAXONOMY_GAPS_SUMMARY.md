# Taxonomy Gaps - Quick Reference

**Status:** Planning Complete  
**Priority:** Critical Blocker  
**Estimated Fix:** 2-6 days depending on scope

---

## The Problem in One Sentence

**Existing taxonomies define AI capabilities and technical prerequisites, but lack the organizational factor layer needed to assess "Can our organization do this AI project?"**

---

## What We Have ‚úÖ

1. **AI Use Case Taxonomy** - 25 AI archetypes (Classification, Forecasting, etc.)
2. **AI Dependency Taxonomy** - 40+ technical prerequisites (Clean data, ML expertise, etc.)
3. **Scoped Factor Model** - Architecture for domain/system-specific assessments

---

## What's Missing ‚ùå

### Critical Gaps (Block Epic 1)

**1. Organizational Factors Taxonomy** üö®
- **Missing:** Structured definition of 15 assessable organizational attributes
- **Need:** 0-100 scales with observable anchors for each factor
- **Impact:** Cannot infer "data_quality = 30" from user saying "data scattered across 5 systems"
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "factor_id": "data_quality",
    "scale": {
      "0": "No quality controls",
      "20": "Ad-hoc checks, many issues",
      "40": "Basic processes",
      "60": "Systematic framework",
      "80": "Comprehensive governance",
      "100": "World-class quality"
    }
  }
  ```

**2. Factor-to-Capability Mapping** üö®
- **Missing:** How factors combine to enable project types
- **Need:** Weights, thresholds, importance levels per capability
- **Impact:** Cannot evaluate "Can we do sales forecasting?" from assessed factors
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "capability": "supervised_classification",
    "requirements": [
      {"factor": "data_quality", "weight": 0.25, "threshold": 50},
      {"factor": "ml_expertise", "weight": 0.15, "threshold": 40}
    ]
  }
  ```

### High Priority Gaps

**3. Factor Interdependencies** üî¥
- **Missing:** How factors influence each other
- **Impact:** Cannot model "executive support mitigates expertise gaps"

**4. Prerequisite-to-Factor Mapping** üî¥
- **Missing:** Link between technical prerequisites and organizational factors
- **Impact:** Cannot determine "Is 'Clean_and_validated_data' satisfied?"

### Medium Priority Gaps

**5. Assessment Metadata** üü°
- **Missing:** Time-to-assess, confidence impact, ROI data
- **Impact:** Cannot prioritize "what's next" suggestions

**6. Factor-to-Archetype Impact** üü°
- **Missing:** Which factors improve which archetypes
- **Impact:** Cannot answer "Improving data governance helps which projects?"

## Why This Blocks Knowledge Graph

**Current graph structure:**
```
AI_ARCHETYPE ‚Üí PREREQUISITE ‚Üí MODEL ‚Üí OUTPUT
```

**Required graph structure:**
```
CONVERSATION ‚Üí FACTOR ‚Üí PREREQUISITE ‚Üí CAPABILITY ‚Üí ARCHETYPE
                ‚Üì           ‚Üì              ‚Üì
            FACTOR_SCALE  FACTOR_MAP   CONFIDENCE
```

**Missing edges:** All connections involving FACTOR nodes

## The Fix: 6-Phase Roadmap

### Phase 1-2: Minimum Viable (2-3 days) üö®
- Define 15 factors with scales
- Map factors to 6 capabilities
- **Unblocks:** Epic 1 implementation

### Phase 3-4: Recommended (4-5 days) üî¥
- Add factor interdependencies
- Link prerequisites to factors
- **Unblocks:** Full knowledge graph, project feasibility

### Phase 5-6: Complete (5-6 days) üü°
- Add assessment metadata
- Add factor-archetype impacts
- **Unblocks:** ROI suggestions, factor improvement recommendations

  "category": "data_readiness",
  
  "scale": {
    "type": "0-100",

      "100": "World-class quality, real-time monitoring"
    }
  },
  
  "scope_dimensions": {
