# Implementation Summary - Exploratory Assessment Architecture

## What Changed

### 1. **Dropped Linear Process** (`linear_discovery_process.md`)
- ❌ Removed rigid Problem → Options → Evidence → Decision flow
- ✅ Users can now start anywhere, jump freely
- ✅ System never blocks exploration

### 2. **New Architecture Document** (`exploratory_assessment_architecture.md`)
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Always-proceed project evaluation with confidence scoring
- Unconfirmed inferences tracking
- Pareto-driven "what's next" suggestions
- Risk-based "good enough" thresholds
- Flexible entry points
- Multi-session continuity patterns

### 3. **Updated Persistence** (`conversation_memory_architecture.md`)
Added inference tracking to factor storage:
```yaml
/factors/{factor_id}:
  inference_status: "unconfirmed" | "confirmed" | "user_provided"
  inferred_from_conversation: "User mentioned data scattered..."
```

New methods in `FactorJournalStore`:
- `get_unconfirmed_factors()` - Retrieve all unconfirmed inferences
- `confirm_factor()` - User validates or corrects inference
- `get_assessment_summary()` - Now includes unconfirmed list

### 4. **Updated UX Guidelines** (`user_interaction_guideline.md`)
Added to orientative patterns:
- Surface unconfirmed inferences in status queries
- Show confirmed vs unconfirmed factors
- Offer quick validation with confidence boost
- New principle: "Surface Unconfirmed Inferences"

---

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. **Never Block Exploration**
```python
# OLD (blocked):
if not has_required_factors():
    return "You need to assess X, Y, Z first"

# NEW (always proceed):
confidence = calculate_confidence(available_factors)
return f"Feasibility: {confidence}% confident. Missing: {gaps}. Proceed anyway?"
```

### 2. **Track Inference Status**
```python
# LLM infers from conversation
update_factor(
    factor_id="data_quality",
    value=20,
    rationale="User mentioned scattered data",
    inference_status="unconfirmed"  # Not validated yet
)

# User validates
confirm_factor(
    factor_id="data_quality",
    confirmed_value=20  # Or corrects to different value
)
```

### 3. **Surface Unconfirmed in Status**
```
System: "Here's what we've mapped out:

**Confirmed:**
- data_availability: 80% ✓

**Unconfirmed (I inferred these):**
- data_quality: 20% (from 'scattered data')
- data_governance: 15% (from 'no formal policies')

Want to confirm these, or move on?"
```

### 4. **Pareto-Driven Suggestions**
```python
# Show ROI of continuing
suggestions = [
    {"action": "Assess data governance", "time": "10 min", "gain": "+15%", "roi": 1.5},
    {"action": "Discuss team skills", "time": "5 min", "gain": "+10%", "roi": 2.0},
]

# Signal diminishing returns
"Top 3 actions: +33% confidence in 20 min.
Remaining 12 factors: only +10% more. Probably not worth it."
```

### 5. **Risk-Based Thresholds**
```python
def get_recommended_confidence(cost: int) -> float:
    if cost < 25000:
        return 0.40  # Low-risk pilot
    elif cost < 100000:
        return 0.60  # Medium-risk
    else:
        return 0.75  # High-stakes
```

---

## TBD Items (Documented, Not Implemented)

### 1. **Project Ideas Persistence**
```yaml
/users/{user_id}/projects/{project_id}:
  name: "Sales forecasting"
  estimated_cost: 50000
  feasibility_snapshot:
    confidence: 0.45
    gaps: ["data_governance"]
  status: "exploring" | "ready" | "blocked"
```

### 2. **Factor Export/Import (Spreadsheet)**
```csv
factor_id,factor_name,current_value,confidence,rationale,status
data_quality,Data Quality,20,0.75,"Data scattered...",unconfirmed
```

**Import behavior:**
- Flag all as low confidence (0.30)
- LLM validates against knowledge graph scale
- If LLM agrees → raise to 0.70
- If disagrees → flag for review

### 3. **Partial Import (Colleague Input)**
```python
# User exports subset for colleague
export_factors_for_colleague(
    user_id="user123",
    factor_category="data_readiness",
    colleague_name="Data Team Lead"
)

# Colleague fills in, user imports back
import_partial_factors(user_id, "colleague_input.csv")
# System detects conflicts, suggests discussion
```

## Example Conversation Flow

### Scenario: User wants to evaluate a project

```
User: "Can we do sales forecasting?"

System: [Checks factor journal]
"Based on what we've discussed:

**Feasibility: Proceed with caution (45% confidence)**

Why 45%?
- ✅ Data availability: 80% (you have 3 years of sales data)
- ⚠️ Data quality: 20% (I inferred from 'scattered data'—not confirmed)
- ❓ ML infrastructure: unknown

**For a €15k pilot, 45% is borderline.**

**Quick wins:**
1. Confirm data quality (2 min) → Clarify biggest uncertainty
2. Assess ML infrastructure (5 min) → +10% confidence

Or proceed now as high-risk pilot. Your call."

User: "Yeah, data quality is about right. What about ML infrastructure?"

System: [Marks data_quality as confirmed, boosts confidence to 0.85]
"Got it, confirmed data_quality = 20%.

Tell me about your ML infrastructure. Do you have:
- Cloud compute (AWS, Azure, GCP)?
- ML platforms (SageMaker, Databricks)?
- Or mostly manual/local?"

User: "We have AWS but no ML platform yet."

System: [Infers ml_infrastructure = 40%, unconfirmed]
"Okay, so basic cloud but no ML platform. That puts ML infrastructure around 40%.

**Updated feasibility: 55% confidence**

You're now at the threshold for a €15k pilot. 

**What's next:**
- Start planning the pilot (we have enough to proceed)
- Assess data governance (10 min) → +15% confidence
- Explore team skills → See if you need external help

What sounds good?"
```

## Key Success Metrics

### Users should feel:
- ✅ Free to explore without structure
- ✅ Confident in "good enough" decisions
- ✅ Aware of what would improve confidence
- ✅ System remembers everything

### Users should never feel:
- ❌ Blocked from exploring
- ❌ Forced to complete everything
- ❌ Unsure what system "knows"
- ❌ Like filling out forms

### System should:
- ✅ Track all inferences (confirmed + unconfirmed)
- ✅ Surface unconfirmed in every status query
- ✅ Show confidence on all assessments
- ✅ Suggest high-ROI next steps
- ✅ Signal diminishing returns
- ✅ Support risk-based thresholds

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this summary with team
2. **Prioritize** Phase 1 implementation tasks
3. **Define** factor taxonomy (categories, scales)
4. **Implement** `FactorJournalStore` extensions
5. **Build** evaluation and suggestion logic
6. **Test** with real conversations
7. **Iterate** based on user feedback

---

## Questions for Implementation

1. **Factor taxonomy:** What are all the factor categories? (data_readiness, ai_capability, cultural_fit, ...)
2. **Confidence scales:** What defines 20% vs 80% for each factor?
3. **Project archetypes:** What project types map to which factors?
4. **ROI calculation:** How to estimate confidence gain per factor?
5. **Diminishing returns threshold:** When to signal "good enough"? (5% gain?)
6. **Unconfirmed surfacing frequency:** Every status query? Only when >3 unconfirmed?
7. **Confirmation UX:** Explicit "confirm these?" or implicit from continued conversation?
