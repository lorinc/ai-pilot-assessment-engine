This relationship diagram outlines the structure of the knowledge graph, incorporating the highly granular **Pain** dimensions requested, and mapping how the organizational context connects to the AI solution layer via dependencies and outcomes.

The diagram is organized into four main layers: **Organizational Context**, **Granular Pain Assessment**, **AI Solution Layer**, and **Implementation Requirements**.

## Knowledge Graph Relationship Diagram

### I. Organizational Context Layer (The "Who/Where/How Ready")

This layer describes the environment and infrastructure where the AI project is deployed.

| Source Node | Relationship (Edge Type) | Target Node | Context / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BUSINESS\_FUNCTION** | **OPERATES\_IN** | **BUSINESS\_TOOL/PROCESS** | Functions utilize specific tools (e.g., Manufacturing uses MES Systems). |
| **BUSINESS\_FUNCTION** | **LOCATED\_IN** | **BUSINESS\_SECTOR** | Defines the industry context (e.g., Sales in Retail). |
| **AI\_MATURITY\_STAGE** | **GOVERNS\_READINESS\_FOR** | **AI\_PREREQUISITE** | Links the organization's current maturity level (e.g., Siloed Data) to the difficulty of satisfying a prerequisite (e.g., Clean Data). |

### II. Granular Pain Assessment Layer (The "Why/What Specifically")

This layer provides the necessary high-granularity link between abstract pain and measurable organizational failure.

| Source Node | Relationship (Edge Type) | Target Node | Granularity / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEM\_TYPE** (Broad Pain) | **CONTEXTUALIZED\_BY** | **OPERATIONAL\_PAIN\_POINT** (M1) | Connects abstract pain (e.g., "Quality gaps") to a specific function and tool context. |
| **OPERATIONAL\_PAIN\_POINT** (M1) | **MANIFESTS\_AS** | **MEASURABLE\_FAILURE\_MODE** (M2) | Defines the quantifiable metric of failure (e.g., "Unplanned Downtime" manifests as "Low MTBF"). |
| **OPERATIONAL\_PAIN\_POINT** (M1) | **AFFECTS\_TOOL** | **BUSINESS\_TOOL/PROCESS** | Anchors the pain to the technology or process being disrupted (e.g., failure affects the MES system). |

### III. AI Solution Layer (The "What AI Does")

This layer defines the technical capabilities, models, and outputs drawn primarily from the `AI_Use_Case_Archetypes`.

| Source Node | Relationship (Edge Type) | Target Node | Context / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI\_ARCHETYPE** | **IMPLEMENTED\_BY** | **COMMON\_MODEL** | Specifies the algorithms used (e.g., Classification implemented by XGBoost). |
| **AI\_ARCHETYPE** | **PRODUCES\_OUTPUT** | **AI\_OUTPUT** | Defines the resulting artifact (e.g., Anomaly Detection produces "Equipment fault alert"). |
| **AI\_ARCHETYPE** | **HAS\_PURPOSE** | **ANALYTICAL\_PURPOSE** | Categorizes the objective (e.g., Regression has "Predictive" purpose). |
| **AI\_ARCHETYPE** | **BELONGS\_TO** | **TECHNICAL\_FAMILY** | Defines the learning paradigm (e.g., Anomaly Detection belongs to "Unsupervised Learning"). |
| **AI\_ARCHETYPE** | **APPLIES\_TO\_FUNCTION** | **BUSINESS\_FUNCTION** | High-level applicability (e.g., Intent Detection applies to "Customer Support"). |

### IV. Inter-Layer Connections (Justification and Feasibility)

These are the most critical traversal paths for project discovery, linking AI solutions back to the business needs and forward to the organizational requirements.

#### A. Solution-to-Pain Link (Justification)

| Source Node | Relationship (Edge Type) | Target Node | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI\_OUTPUT** | **MITIGATES\_FAILURE** | **MEASURABLE\_FAILURE\_MODE** (M2) | **(The Core Discovery Path):** Directly links the AI result (e.g., "Fraud flagging") to the quantifiable business failure it seeks to solve (e.g., high "Chargeback rate"). |
| **AI\_ARCHETYPE** | **ENABLES\_FUNCTION** | **BUSINESS\_FUNCTION** | Links the core capability back to the strategic area of benefit (e.g., Optimization enables "Supply Chain & Logistics"). |

#### B. Solution-to-Prerequisite Link (Feasibility)

| Source Node | Relationship (Edge Type) | Target Node | Source / Requirement Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **COMMON\_MODEL** | **REQUIRES** | **AI\_PREREQUISITE** | Technical dependency (e.g., Isolation Forest REQUIRES Clean Data). |
| **AI\_OUTPUT** | **REQUIRES** | **AI\_PREREQUISITE** | Output dependency (e.g., "Sales forecast" REQUIRES Large Historical Datasets). |

## Summary Traversal Path (What AI Project to Choose)

The full discovery process would traverse these layers in sequence:

$$\text{BUSINESS\_FUNCTION} \xrightarrow{\text{OPERATES\_IN}} \text{BUSINESS\_TOOL} \leftarrow \text{AFFECTS\_TOOL} \text{ OPERATIONAL\_PAIN\_POINT} \xrightarrow{\text{MANIFESTS\_AS}} \text{MEASURABLE\_FAILURE\_MODE}$$

$$\text{MEASURABLE\_FAILURE\_MODE} \xleftarrow{\text{MITIGATES\_FAILURE}} \text{AI\_OUTPUT} \leftarrow \text{PRODUCES\_OUTPUT} \text{ AI\_ARCHETYPE}$$

$$\text{AI\_OUTPUT} \xrightarrow{\text{REQUIRES}} \text{AI\_PREREQUISITE} \leftarrow \text{GOVERNS\_READINESS\_FOR} \text{ AI\_MATURITY\_STAGE}$$
