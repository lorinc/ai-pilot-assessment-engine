  REAL GEMINI INTEGRATION TEST - Day 10 UAT (Refactored)
🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯

⚠️  This test makes REAL Gemini API calls via Vertex AI
   Cost: ~$0.0001 per test run (Gemini is cheaper than OpenAI)

📋 Architecture:
   - Uses existing src/core/llm_client.py (Gemini via Vertex AI)
   - Consistent with project infrastructure
   - No duplicate LLM providers


================================================================================
  REAL Gemini Integration Test
================================================================================

Initializing Gemini via Vertex AI...
✅ LLMClient initialized: gemini-2.5-flash
   Project: ai-assessment-engine-476709
   Location: europe-west1

✅ LLMResponseGenerator initialized with Gemini

📍 Test 1: Simple Reactive Response
   User: 'We need to assess sales forecasting in our CRM'

   Calling Gemini API...

   ✅ Response received:
   "Sales forecasting in your CRM is a great area to explore for an AI pilot. To ensure I'm on the right track, are you primarily looking to improve the accuracy of your current sales forecasts, predict future sales trends more effectively, or perhaps automate parts of the forecasting process?"

   Length: 290 characters (~49 words)

📍 Test 2: Reactive + Proactive Response
   User: 'The data quality is about 3 stars'

   Calling Gemini API...

   ✅ Response received:
   "Understood. I've noted your 3-star rating for data quality.

To help us understand this better, which team or department is primarily responsible for managing and improving data quality within your organization?"

   Length: 211 characters (~31 words)

📊 Verification:

   ✅ Both responses generated successfully
   ✅ Responses are contextually different
   ✅ Token budgets respected (~49 and ~31 words)

================================================================================
  ✅ REAL GEMINI INTEGRATION TEST PASSED
================================================================================


✅ Day 10 LLM Integration: VERIFIED WITH REAL GEMINI API

🎉 Refactoring Complete:
  - Removed OpenAI dependency
  - Using existing Gemini/Vertex AI infrastructure
  - Consistent with project architecture
  - All tests passing

Next Steps:
  - Day 11-12: Intent detection
  - Day 13: Multi-output support
