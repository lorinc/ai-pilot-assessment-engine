### Answer

Refocus the graph as a **Decision-to-Act system**: stop at a clear **Go/No-Go/Time-boxed Try** decision, while capturing a **projection** (plan, metrics, risks) without executing it. Add explicit nodes for **Objectives, Options, Evidence, Uncertainty, Constraints, Decision Rule**, and a **Decision Record**. Use **metric thresholds** to define the trigger for action.

### Reasoning (why this fits your scope)

Leaders need a crisp bridge from “we think we have a problem” to “we authorize action.” This model already frames problem formation; extending it to include **option evaluation** and **decision rules** yields a defensible, auditable decision without modeling execution.

### Minimal object model (stops at decision; includes projections)

* **Signal/Data → Interpretation**
* **Norms/Policies → Expectations**
* **Problem** (falsifiable statement; stake & scope)
* **Objectives** (business outcomes; timebound)
* **Constraints** (budget, time, capabilities)
* **Assumptions/Hypotheses** (with confidence)
* **Options** (incl. *Do nothing* / *Delay*)
* **Evidence** (internal data, external sources; quality rating)
* **Impact Model (projection)** per Option (how it moves Objectives)
* **Risks & Reversibility** per Option
* **Effort & Cost** (one-off, run)
* **Metrics & Guardrails** (leading/lagging; projections only)
* **Decision Rule** (trigger = thresholds on metrics/conditions)
* **Decision Record** (Go/No-Go/Try-for-N-weeks + rationale)
 

---

### “Decision Readiness” checklist (gate before Go)

* Problem statement is **falsifiable** and **valuable**.
* At least **3 Options** considered (*Do nothing* included).
* Evidence quality rated; key assumptions listed with confidence.
* Objectives mapped to **measurable metrics** with targets.
* Constraints acknowledged; **reversibility** scored.
* **Decision Rule** formulated (e.g., “Proceed if pilot can be run under €25k and projected cycle time reduction ≥15% at p90”).
* **Decision owner** named; **Decision Record** drafted.
 

---

### Compact scoring (editable, transparent)

* **Value** = Expected Impact × Confidence.
* **Speed** = Reversibility ÷ Effort.
* **Priority** = Value × Cost-of-Delay factor.
  Surface as a 2×2 (Impact vs Effort) with Confidence as label; supports quick Go/No-Go/Try.

### Graph edges (starter)

* `informs`: Signal → Interpretation
* `shapes`: Norms → Expectations
* `reframes`: Interpretation/Expectations → Problem
* `targets`: Problem → Objectives
* `constrains`: Constraints → Options
* `assumes`: Option → Assumption
* `supported_by`: Option → Evidence
* `projects_with`: Option → Impact Model / Metrics
* `evaluated_by`: Option → Decision Rule
* `decides`: Decision Record → Option

### UI flow (one screen = one object type)

1. **Problem & Objectives**
2. **Options** (force ≥3; include *Do nothing*)
3. **Evidence & Assumptions** (quick confidence sliders, notes)
4. **Impact & Metrics (projection)**
5. **Risks, Effort, Reversibility**
6. **Decision Rule** (auto-suggested from metrics; editable)
7. **Decision Record** (Go/No-Go/Try-N-weeks; rationale + owner)

---

### Outputs to store (audit + reuse)

* **Decision Packet**: Problem, Objectives, Options table, Evidence links, Projection, Risks, Decision Rule, Decision Record.
* **Assumption Register**: what to test *if* action proceeds.
* **Metric Template**: names, formulas, target thresholds (projection only).
 

---

### Small but high-leverage changes

* Rename **Trigger → Decision Rule**; require thresholds.
* Add **Decision Record** node; make the decision explicit.
* Make **Do Nothing** a first-class Option; often wins under low Value/Speed.
* Add **Reversibility** and **Cost-of-Delay** as mandatory fields.

---

### Risks / unknowns

* Overhead risk: too many fields slow usage → mitigate with sensible defaults and progressive disclosure.
* False precision in projections → show ranges and confidence; mark as “projection, not commitment.”
* Politics invisible in scores → capture **rationale** and **editor identity** in the Decision Record.

---

### Draft → atomic edits

* ✅ Add nodes: **Objectives, Options, Evidence, Assumptions, Metrics, Decision Rule, Decision Record**.
* ✅ Enforce **≥3 options** including **Do Nothing**.
* ✅ Implement **Value/Speed/Priority** scores; keep formulas editable.
* ✅ Generate a **Decision Packet** artifact at the end of the flow.
