# 2025-11-01: Output-Centric Model Scope Lock & Documentation Update

**Date:** 2025-11-01  
**Version:** 0.3  
**Status:** Scope Locked & Documentation Complete  
**Impact:** Major - Fundamental design simplifications + full documentation coherence

---

## Summary

Completed two major milestones today:

1. **Scope Lock:** Applied critical scope constraints to the output-centric factor model to prevent complexity explosion. All open questions resolved with bias toward simplicity and honest estimation over false precision.

2. **Documentation Coherence:** Updated all 8 core documentation files to reflect the scope-locked model with 1-5 star ratings. Entire project documentation now consistent.

**Core Philosophy:** "The more we specify system requirements, the faster the scope accelerates away. I want the scope to stop."

**The Breakthrough:** The major innovation is NOT the 1-5 star system (that's a simplification detail). The breakthrough is the output-centric model that creates a direct link from assessment to AI solution recommendations via simple KG inference.

## Key Decisions

### 1. ✅ Factor Scoring: 1-5 Stars (Not 0-100)

**Rationale:**
- All factor values are rough estimations—representation should reflect that
- Prevents false precision ("65 vs 70" is meaningless)
- Standardized across entire system
- Makes factor calculation simpler and more arbitrary (which is good, because it IS arbitrary)
- Industry-standard pattern everyone understands

**Scale:**
- ⭐ (1 star): Critical issues, major blockers, fundamentally broken
- ⭐⭐ (2 stars): Significant problems, frequent failures, needs major work
- ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars): Functional but inconsistent, room for improvement
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 stars): Good quality, minor issues, mostly reliable
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars): Excellent, consistent, best-in-class

**Impact:**
- All factors: 1-5 integer values
- All components: 1-5 integer values
- All dependencies: 1-5 strength ratings
- No decimals, no percentages, no 0-100 scales anywhere

---

### 2. ✅ Factor Calculation: MIN (Weakest Link)

**Rationale:**
- "Good inputs + good engineers + bad QA = still bad output"
- Chain is only as strong as weakest link
- Arbitrary calculation is honest—we're estimating, not measuring precisely
- Simpler than weighted averages
- Highlights bottlenecks clearly

**Formula:**
```
Output_Factor = MIN(Dependency_Quality, Team_Execution, Process_Maturity, System_Support)
```

**Example:**
- Dependency Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 stars)
- Team Execution: ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars)
- Process Maturity: ⭐⭐ (2 stars) ← BOTTLENECK
- System Support: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars)
- **Result: ⭐⭐ (2 stars)** - Process is the limiting factor

**Deprecated:** Weighted average approach (0.25 each or archetype-specific weights)

---

### 3. ✅ Feedback Loops: Detect + Communicate Only

**Rationale:**
- Feedback loops are valuable organizational insights
- Detecting and communicating them adds value
- Managing loop dynamics adds significant complexity
- Scope constraint: Keep system focused on core assessment

**Implementation:**
- Detect loops during dependency traversal
- Flag as "positive feedback loop" in diagnostics
- Explain effect: "Virtuous cycle" or "Vicious cycle"
- Communicate what can be done: "Breaking this loop by improving [Output X] would have cascading benefits"
- **Do NOT:** Track loop momentum, predict evolution, manage loop-breaking strategies

**Future:** TBD marker for potential enhancement if user demand emerges

---

### 4. ✅ Multi-Output Pilots: One Pilot = One Output

**Rationale:**
- Scope constraint: Prevents complexity explosion
- Pilots are scoped to specific, measurable outcomes
- One output = clear success criteria
- Multi-output optimization adds significant assessment complexity

**Implementation:**
- Each AI Pilot targets exactly one output
- System detects and communicates cascading effects: "Improving Clean Customer Data will also benefit Sales Forecast and Inventory Plan"
- User understands broader impact, but pilot assessed against primary output only
- **Do NOT:** Assess feasibility across multiple outputs, track multi-output ROI, optimize for multiple targets

---

### 5. ✅ Temporal Dynamics: Ignore

**Rationale:**
- Scope constraint: Time-series tracking adds significant complexity
- If something improves, user will tell us
- System will know current state through new assessment
- Prediction is unreliable and adds false precision

**Implementation:**
- Store factor assessments with timestamps (audit trail only)
- **Do NOT:** Track trends, predict future states, show historical charts, use temporal data in recommendations
- Each assessment is a snapshot of current state
- User can re-assess anytime to capture changes
- System treats each assessment independently

**User Communication:**
- "Based on current state..."
- No promises about future feasibility
- If user mentions planned improvements: "Great! Re-assess after those changes to see updated feasibility"

---

### 6. ✅ Cross-Functional Dependencies: Simple Model Only

**Rationale:**
- Scope constraint: Complex cross-functional modeling explodes complexity
- The model already handles this: Output A (Team 1) depends on Output B (Team 2)
- Dependency graph captures cross-team relationships naturally
- User understands their context, system doesn't need to manage it

**Model:**
- **One output** is produced by:
  - **One team** (the team responsible)
  - Using **one system** (primary system)
  - Depending on **multiple upstream outputs** (from any teams/systems)
- This simple model can handle any complexity if user uses it well

**Implementation:**
- Store team_id and system_id with each output
- Dependencies can cross team/system boundaries (no special handling)
- System can detect: "Sales Forecast (Sales Team) depends on Clean Data (Data Engineering Team)"
- Communicate collaboration need, but don't manage it
- **Do NOT:** Model matrix organizations, shared ownership, cross-functional governance, organizational silos

## Notes

This scope lock represents a critical pivot toward simplicity and honesty about the estimation nature of the system. By embracing rough approximations (stars) and simple logic (MIN), we prevent the false precision trap and keep the system implementable.

The philosophy: "It IS arbitrary, so let's be honest about it and make it simple."

The documentation update ensures the entire project is now coherent and aligned with the scope-locked output-centric model.
