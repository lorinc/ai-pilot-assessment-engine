### Initial commit: AI Pilot Assessment Engine
**Commit:** `ff35662` | **Date:** 2025-10-20 22:29:56

**Summary:**
Project foundation established with three comprehensive JSON taxonomy files and initial README. This commit laid the groundwork for a knowledge graph-based AI assessment system by providing structured domain knowledge about AI use cases, organizational prerequisites, and business discovery patterns. The taxonomies included 491 lines of AI archetypes (classification, regression, anomaly detection, etc.), 987 lines of implementation prerequisites (data quality, infrastructure, expertise requirements), and 680 lines of business discovery patterns (functions, sectors, maturity dimensions). The README outlined the vision for helping organizations evaluate AI project feasibility through structured assessment.

**Files Added:** `AI_archetypes.json`, `AI_discovery.json`, `AI_prerequisites.json`, `README.md`

### docs: add comprehensive system architecture specification document
**Commit:** `548da93` | **Date:** 2025-10-21 01:10:54

**Summary:**
Created the first major architecture document defining the complete system design for the AI Pilot Assessment Engine. This document established the conversational assessment approach, where users would interact through natural dialogue rather than forms or surveys. It detailed the factor-centric design principle (everything links to organizational factors), the hybrid knowledge model (static domain knowledge in Cloud Storage, dynamic user data in Firestore), and the real-time streaming architecture for LLM responses. The document also specified the technology stack (Streamlit, Vertex AI, Firestore, Cloud Run) and provided detailed data schemas, component interfaces, and deployment strategies. This became the foundational reference for all subsequent implementation work.

**Files Added:** `docs/system_architecture_specification.md`

### epics, stories, assumptions + project folder restructuring
**Commit:** `a9085ef` | **Date:** 2025-10-21 08:21:49

**Summary:**
Major project reorganization that moved data files into a proper `src/data/` structure and created comprehensive epic planning documents. This commit introduced the vertical epic methodology where each epic delivers an end-to-end functional slice rather than building all components before integration. Epic 1 was fully specified with implementation-ready tasks for a single-factor conversational assessment with persistence. The restructuring also added planning documents for the linear discovery process, remaining epics overview, and cumulative inference strategy. This organizational change reflected a shift from ad-hoc planning to structured, iterative development with clear milestones and acceptance criteria.

**Files Added:** `docs/epic_01_knowledge_graph_foundation.md`, `docs/linear_discovery_process.md`, `docs/remaining_epics_overview.md`, `docs/CUMULATIVE_INFERENCE_SUMMARY.md`  
**Files Moved:** Data files to `src/data/` directory

### exploring and documenting the knowledge graph structure
**Commit:** `6e0349` | **Date:** 2025-10-21 10:10:05

**Summary:**
Documented the knowledge graph relationship structure with detailed planning for how taxonomies would transform into a traversable graph. This commit created two key documents: a building plan outlining a 4-day rapid integration approach (define nodes/edges, incorporate feasibility constraints, focus on low-dependency prototyping, validate coherence), and a comprehensive relationship diagram showing four layers (Organizational Context, Granular Pain Assessment, AI Solution Layer, Implementation Requirements). The documentation specified exact edge types like CONTEXTUALIZED_BY, MANIFESTS_AS, MITIGATES_FAILURE, and REQUIRES, providing the blueprint for connecting business problems to AI solutions through multi-hop reasoning paths. This was critical for enabling the system to answer questions like "What prerequisites are missing for project X?"

**Files Added:** `src/data/E1S1_KG_building_plan.md`, `src/data/E1S1_how_taxonomies_make_the_graph.md`

### docs: add ASCII diagrams showing project justification and feasibility assessment paths
**Commit:** `452fd0a` | **Date:** 2025-10-21 10:18:41

**Summary:**
Enhanced the knowledge graph documentation with visual ASCII diagrams illustrating the complete traversal paths for project discovery. The diagrams showed two critical reasoning flows: (1) Project Justification path from Business Function → Business Tool → Operational Pain Point → Measurable Failure Mode → AI Output → AI Archetype, and (2) Feasibility Assessment path from AI Archetype → AI Output → AI Prerequisite → AI Maturity Stage. These visualizations made it clear how the system would reason about "Why should we do this project?" (justification) and "Can we actually do it?" (feasibility). The combined traversal example demonstrated how a quality gap manifests as low MTBF, which an equipment fault alert mitigates, but requires continuous data streams that depend on the organization's data maturity level.

**Files Modified:** `src/data/E1S1_how_taxonomies_make_the_graph.md`

### feat: create knowledge graph system with 281 nodes and 758 edges from existing JSON files
**Commit:** `a8f77f4` | **Date:** 2025-10-21 10:46:43

**Summary:**
Implemented the first working knowledge graph construction system using NetworkX and Pydantic schemas. This commit created `graph_builder.py` with a KnowledgeGraphBuilder class that loads AI archetypes, prerequisites, and organizational context from JSON files and constructs a typed, directed graph. The `schemas.py` file defined strongly-typed node classes (AIArchetypeNode, CommonModelNode, AIOutputNode, AIPrerequisiteNode, BusinessFunctionNode, MaturityDimensionNode) and edge types (IMPLEMENTED_BY, PRODUCES_OUTPUT, REQUIRES, etc.) using Pydantic for validation. The system successfully created 281 nodes and 758 edges, providing the foundation for multi-hop reasoning. Test files validated graph construction and statistics, proving the concept of transforming static taxonomies into a queryable graph structure.

**Files Added:** `src/knowledge/graph_builder.py`, `src/knowledge/schemas.py`, `src/knowledge/__init__.py`, `tests/test_graph_builder.py`, `scripts/test_graph_construction.py`

### feat: add Gemini-powered knowledge base enrichment tool with 4-phase pipeline
**Commit:** `2b36bef` | **Date:** 2025-10-21 16:20:49

**Summary:**
Created an interactive Jupyter notebook tool for manually enriching the knowledge graph using Gemini AI assistance. The tool implements a 4-phase pipeline: (1) extract business context nodes (functions, sectors, tools), (2) extract AI archetype nodes (archetypes, models, outputs), (3) create edges between nodes based on relationships, and (4) validate and export the enriched graph. Each phase includes customizable extraction logic with LLM-assisted drafting and human review checkpoints. The notebook provides exploration cells to understand data structure, extraction cells with customizable logic, and validation cells to ensure completeness and consistency. This tool addressed the challenge of enriching taxonomies with additional attributes (scales, assessment times, confidence impacts) needed for the conversational assessment system.

**Files Added:** `tools/KB_Enrichment_Manual.ipynb`

### chore: remove obsolete documentation files and allow Jupyter notebooks
**Commit:** `b1bce47` | **Date:** 2025-10-23 19:57:02

**Summary:**
Cleaned up the repository by moving outdated documentation to an `obsolete/` directory and updating `.gitignore` to track Jupyter notebooks. This commit archived 19 obsolete files including early implementation summaries, enrichment specifications, coherence fixes, and the initial project vision that had been superseded by newer architecture documents. The cleanup also moved the large `AI_discovery.json` file (45KB) to obsolete, indicating a shift in how business discovery data would be structured. By explicitly tracking Jupyter notebooks (removing `*.ipynb` from gitignore), the project acknowledged that notebooks like `KB_Enrichment_Manual.ipynb` were valuable tools for one-time data transformation tasks rather than throwaway experiments.

**Files Moved:** 19 documentation files to `docs/obsolete/`  
**Files Modified:** `.gitignore`

## October 24, 2025

### chore: remove unused taxonomy JSON files from data directory
**Commit:** `d0d35c2` | **Date:** 2025-10-24 15:18:25

**Summary:**
Further repository cleanup removing five unused taxonomy JSON files that were either redundant or had been superseded by better-structured versions. The removed files included automation opportunities, business capabilities, business core functions, business decision dimensions, and problem taxonomies. This cleanup suggested a consolidation of the knowledge graph structure, focusing on the core taxonomies (AI archetypes, AI dependencies/prerequisites) that were actually being used by the graph builder. The reduction from 9 to 4 JSON files simplified the data model and made it clearer which taxonomies were essential for the system's reasoning capabilities.

**Files Removed:** `automation_opportunity_taxonomy.json`, `business_capability_taxonomy.json`, `business_core_function_taxonomy.json`, `business_decision_dimension_taxonomy.json`, `problem_taxonomy.json`

### docs: rewrite project vision from AI assessment to decision-making system
**Commit:** `074642b` | **Date:** 2025-10-25 12:10:24

**Summary:**
Pivotal reframing of the project's core value proposition in the README. The vision shifted from "AI readiness assessment tool" to "AI decision-making companion" that helps organizations navigate the gap between business problems and AI solutions. This rewrite emphasized the system as a thinking partner rather than a checklist enforcer, highlighting three key capabilities: (1) translating business problems into technical requirements, (2) evaluating project feasibility with confidence scoring, and (3) guiding exploration with ROI-driven suggestions. The new framing positioned the system as addressing the "lost in translation" problem where business stakeholders struggle to connect their needs to AI capabilities, and technical teams struggle to understand business context. This philosophical shift influenced all subsequent UX and architecture decisions.

**Files Modified:** `README.md`

### docs: add persistence and portability section highlighting zero effort loss and no lock-in features
**Commit:** `7cc4933` | **Date:** 2025-10-25 12:36:15

**Summary:**
Enhanced the README with a new section addressing user concerns about data ownership and vendor lock-in. The documentation emphasized two key principles: (1) Zero Effort Loss - all conversations, assessments, and insights are stored in user-owned Firestore with full export capabilities to CSV/JSON, and (2) No Lock-In - the system uses standard GCP services with straightforward migration paths to other platforms. This addition reflected a strategic decision to build trust with enterprise users who are wary of proprietary assessment tools that trap their organizational knowledge. The emphasis on data portability and standard formats (CSV for factors, JSON for full context) made the system more attractive for organizations wanting to maintain control over their assessment data.

**Files Modified:** `README.md`

### adjusting UX for LLM
**Commit:** `efeba07` | **Date:** 2025-10-28 09:37:16

**Summary:**
Significant UX refinement based on insights about how LLMs interact with users. This commit introduced the concept of "unconfirmed inferences" where the system tracks whether factor values were explicitly stated by users or inferred by the LLM from conversation. It also added the "good enough" threshold concept where confidence requirements vary by project risk level (€10k pilot needs 40% confidence, €100k project needs 75%). The changes reflected a move away from rigid assessment flows toward a more exploratory, confidence-based approach where users decide when they have sufficient information to proceed. This was a critical evolution in understanding that LLM-based systems should embrace uncertainty and make it transparent rather than pretending to have definitive answers.

**Files Modified:** User interaction guidelines and architecture documents

### docs: add UX design philosophy section to README
**Commit:** `89da10f` | **Date:** 2025-10-28 09:54:23

**Summary:**
Codified the UX design philosophy in the README with three core principles: (1) Conversational, Not Interrogative - the system asks thoughtful questions in context rather than firing off a checklist, (2) Exploratory, Not Linear - users can jump between topics freely with the system maintaining context, and (3) Transparent, Not Black Box - the system shows its reasoning, confidence levels, and what would improve confidence. This section included concrete examples of what users should feel ("supported, not interrogated") versus what they should never feel ("like filling out forms"). The philosophy directly challenged traditional assessment tools that force users through rigid workflows, positioning this system as fundamentally different in its approach to gathering organizational intelligence.

**Files Modified:** `README.md`

### persistence for ad-hoc context rebuild
**Commit:** `9bd2fee` | **Date:** 2025-10-28 10:25:12

**Summary:**
Architectural shift to enable ad-hoc context rebuilding from persistent factor journals. This commit introduced the concept that the system doesn't need to store every conversation turn; instead, it stores factor updates with conversation excerpts, and can rebuild context on-demand by synthesizing all journal entries for relevant factors. This approach reduced storage requirements by 83% compared to event sourcing while maintaining full provenance. The system can now answer questions like "Why do you think our data quality is 20%?" by retrieving all journal entries for data_quality and having the LLM synthesize the evidence. This was a breakthrough in understanding that factor-centric storage is more efficient and useful than conversation-centric storage for decision support systems.

**Files Modified:** Architecture and persistence documents

### docs: simplify conversation memory design to use factor-centric journal approach
**Commit:** `ab16b41` | **Date:** 2025-10-28 11:41:33

**Summary:**
Comprehensive documentation update replacing the event-based conversation memory architecture with the factor-centric journal approach. The new design specified that each factor has a journal of updates (previous value, new value, rationale, conversation excerpt, confidence) rather than storing full conversation history. The document detailed how cumulative inference works: when asked "What's our data quality?", the system retrieves ALL journal entries for data_quality and has the LLM synthesize a current value and confidence score from the accumulated evidence. This approach solved multiple problems: reduced storage costs, enabled better confidence tracking (more evidence = higher confidence), and made it easier to explain reasoning ("based on 3 mentions: scattered data, no catalog, duplicates").

**Files Modified:** `docs/conversation_memory_architecture.md`

### updating conversation persistence and context-rebuilding
**Commit:** `7b9e7c1` | **Date:** 2025-10-28 11:41:44

**Summary:**
Implementation-focused updates to conversation persistence and context rebuilding logic. This commit refined how the system stores conversation excerpts in journal entries (just the relevant portion, not the full conversation) and how it rebuilds context for new queries (retrieve recent journal entries for relevant factors, synthesize current state, include in LLM prompt). The updates also specified the token budget management strategy: prioritize recent entries, summarize old entries if needed, and always include the current synthesized state. This ensured that even with long assessment histories, the system could provide relevant context to the LLM without exceeding token limits.

**Files Modified:** Persistence and context building documentation

### docs: rename architecture options from numbers to letters for clarity
**Commit:** `b844436` | **Date:** 2025-10-28 11:42:37

**Summary:**
Minor documentation improvement changing architecture option labels from "Option 1, 2, 3" to "Option A, B, C" to avoid confusion with numbered lists and steps in the same documents. This small change improved readability when discussing trade-offs between different architectural approaches (e.g., "Option A: Event sourcing vs. Option B: Factor journaling"). The alphabetic labeling made it clearer when referencing specific architectural decisions in other documents and discussions.

**Files Modified:** Architecture documentation

### docs: replace event-based memory with factor-centric journal architecture
**Commit:** `a6cecc4` | **Date:** 2025-10-28 11:43:34

**Summary:**
Finalized the architectural decision to use factor-centric journaling by completely replacing event-based memory documentation with the new approach. This commit removed all references to storing conversation events and conversation summaries, replacing them with factor journal entries and on-demand synthesis. The documentation now clearly stated that the system stores factor updates (not conversations), retrieves relevant factors (not conversation history), and synthesizes current state (not replays events). This architectural clarity was essential for implementation, as it eliminated ambiguity about what data structures were needed and how context would be managed across sessions.

**Files Modified:** `docs/conversation_memory_architecture.md`

### docs: replace hardcoded query patterns with generalizable two-stage context retrieval system
**Commit:** `8ef2838` | **Date:** 2025-10-28 11:50:43

**Summary:**
Evolved the context retrieval strategy from hardcoded query patterns ("if user asks X, retrieve Y") to a generalizable two-stage system. Stage 1: Intent Classification - the LLM identifies what the user is trying to do (assess factor, evaluate project, check status, ask "what's next"). Stage 2: Context Retrieval - based on intent, the system retrieves relevant factors, traverses the knowledge graph for dependencies, and builds context. This approach eliminated the need to anticipate every possible query pattern and instead relied on the LLM's natural language understanding to determine what context is needed. The two-stage system was more flexible, maintainable, and aligned with the exploratory UX philosophy where users can ask anything, anytime.

**Files Modified:** Context retrieval and orchestration documentation

### feat: add orientative query support with aggregate metrics and conversation patterns
**Commit:** `adf01a3` | **Date:** 2025-10-28 13:16:46

**Summary:**
Added support for "orientative queries" where users ask meta-questions about their assessment progress: "Where are we?", "What have we covered?", "What can we do now?". The system now calculates aggregate metrics (percentage of factors assessed, overall confidence by category, enabled project types) and formats them into conversational responses. The implementation included conversation patterns for different query types: status checks show factor coverage and confidence, capability queries show what projects can be evaluated, and "what's next" queries show ROI-ranked suggestions. This feature addressed the user need to periodically step back and understand the big picture rather than staying focused on individual factors.

**Files Modified:** Orchestration and response generation documentation

### docs: add inference status tracking and user confirmation flow to factor journal store
**Commit:** `1657541` | **Date:** 2025-10-28 15:16:42

**Summary:**
Enhanced the factor journal store design to track inference status (unconfirmed, confirmed, user_provided) and support user confirmation flows. When the system infers a factor value from conversation, it's marked as "unconfirmed" until the user validates it. The documentation specified how confirmation works: the system can proactively ask "I've been assuming your data governance is around 15% based on you mentioning 'no formal policies.' Is that accurate?", and the user can confirm, correct, or provide more detail. Confirmed factors have higher confidence and are displayed differently in the UI. This feature addressed the trust issue where users were skeptical of LLM inferences, making the system's reasoning transparent and giving users control over what gets locked in as "truth."

**Files Modified:** `docs/gcp_data_schemas.md`, factor journal store documentation

### docs: consolidating learnings into documentation
**Commit:** `edc9662` | **Date:** 2025-10-28 18:52:09

**Summary:**
Major documentation consolidation that synthesized learnings from the previous week of architectural exploration. This commit created or updated several key documents: exploratory assessment architecture (explaining the shift from linear to exploratory flow), user interaction guidelines (conversational patterns and confidence-based guidance), and system interactions (how components communicate). The consolidation removed contradictions between documents, established consistent terminology, and created a clear narrative from high-level philosophy to implementation details. This was essential preparation for Epic 1 implementation, ensuring that all architectural decisions were documented and aligned before writing code.

**Files Modified/Added:** `docs/exploratory_assessment_architecture.md`, `docs/user_interaction_guideline.md`, `docs/system_interactions.md`

## October 29, 2025

### Design documents for system architecture, contracts, and data models
**Commit:** `5572dc3` | **Date:** 2025-10-29 15:25:43

**Summary:**
Created three comprehensive design documents that serve as the implementation blueprint: (1) Architecture Summary - high-level overview of core principles, components, and data flow with concrete examples, (2) GCP Data Schemas - detailed Firestore schema definitions for factors, journal entries, and project evaluations with validation rules, and (3) GCP Technical Architecture - complete technical specification including API contracts, deployment configuration, security rules, and cost estimates. These documents represented the culmination of architectural exploration, providing everything needed to start implementation. The architecture summary included a full end-to-end example ("Can we do sales forecasting?") showing exactly how data flows through the system from user input to LLM response.

**Files Added:** `docs/architecture_summary.md`, `docs/gcp_data_schemas.md`, `docs/gcp_technical_architecture.md`

### docs: add GCP technical architecture and quick links to README
**Commit:** `2eecd0c` | **Date:** 2025-10-29 15:39:18

**Summary:**
Updated the README with quick links to all major documentation and added a reference to the new GCP technical architecture document. The quick links section organized documentation into logical categories: Vision & Philosophy, Architecture & Design, Implementation Guides, and Data Models. This made it easy for new contributors or stakeholders to find relevant documentation without navigating the full file structure. The addition of the GCP technical architecture link signaled that the project was moving from design to implementation phase, with deployment-ready specifications available.

**Files Modified:** `README.md`

### docs: remove outdated conversation memory architecture documentation
**Commit:** `f714a31` | **Date:** 2025-10-29 15:45:12

**Summary:**
Removed the standalone conversation memory architecture document since its content had been fully integrated into the architecture summary and exploratory assessment architecture documents. This cleanup eliminated redundancy and potential confusion from having multiple documents describing the same concepts with slight variations. The factor-centric journal approach was now the single source of truth, documented in the architecture summary with implementation details in the data schemas document. This reflected the project's maturation from exploration (multiple competing ideas) to implementation (one clear approach).

**Files Removed:** `docs/conversation_memory_architecture.md`

### prep for epic 1
**Commit:** `945b100` | **Date:** 2025-10-29 19:49:54

**Summary:**
Prepared the project for Epic 1 implementation by creating the vertical epics document with full specification for the first epic: Single-Factor Conversational Assessment with Persistence. This document detailed the complete user journey, technical scope, implementation tasks (8 phases over 2 weeks), acceptance criteria, and success metrics. Epic 1 was scoped to deliver a working system where users can discuss one organizational factor (data_quality), see it inferred and stored, and understand the system's intelligence through three panels (chat, knowledge tree, technical log). The document also outlined Epics 2-4 at high level for planning purposes, establishing the iterative development approach: prove the concept with one factor, then expand to multiple factors, then add project evaluation, then add "what's next" guidance.

**Files Added:** `docs/VERTICAL_EPICS.md`

### one-button GCP deployment setup
**Commit:** `fb29667` | **Date:** 2025-10-29 20:11:38

**Summary:**
Created automated deployment infrastructure with a one-button setup script for GCP. The `setup-infrastructure.sh` script automates the entire GCP project setup: enabling required APIs (Cloud Run, Vertex AI, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Firebase), creating Firestore database, setting up Cloud Storage bucket for the static knowledge graph, configuring IAM roles, and initializing Firebase for authentication. The script includes comprehensive error handling, progress indicators, and validation checks to ensure each step completes successfully before proceeding. This automation reduced deployment time from hours of manual GCP console work to a single command, making it easy to spin up new environments for testing or production. The deployment directory also included Firestore security rules and a detailed README with prerequisites and troubleshooting.

**Files Added:** `deployment/setup-infrastructure.sh`, `deployment/firestore.rules`, `deployment/.env.template`, `deployment/README.md`

### docs: add region validation and improve error handling in infrastructure setup
**Commit:** `9d89b10` | **Date:** 2025-10-30 11:32:20

**Summary:**
Enhanced the deployment script with region validation and improved error handling. The script now validates that the specified GCP region exists and is available before attempting to create resources, preventing cryptic errors from invalid region names. Error handling was improved with clearer error messages that explain what went wrong and suggest fixes (e.g., "Region 'us-west99' not found. Valid regions include: us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1..."). The script also added rollback capabilities for partial failures, ensuring that if deployment fails midway, it cleans up any resources that were created. These improvements made the deployment process more robust and user-friendly, especially for users unfamiliar with GCP's region naming conventions.

**Files Modified:** `deployment/setup-infrastructure.sh`

### feat: automate Firebase CLI setup and simplify Firestore security rules
**Commit:** `0a8717` | **Date:** 2025-10-30 12:54:48

**Summary:**
Automated Firebase CLI installation and configuration within the deployment script, eliminating a manual prerequisite. The script now checks if Firebase CLI is installed, installs it via npm if missing, and automatically runs `firebase login` and `firebase init` with the correct project settings. The Firestore security rules were also simplified from complex nested conditions to clear, readable rules: users can only read/write their own data under `/users/{userId}/`, and all operations require authentication. This simplification made the rules easier to audit for security and easier to extend as new collections are added. The automation meant that users could run a single script on a fresh machine and have a fully configured GCP + Firebase environment ready for deployment.

**Files Modified:** `deployment/setup-infrastructure.sh`, `deployment/firestore.rules`

### Knowledge graph guide - from ideation to implementation and maintenance
**Commit:** `4dc36bf` | **Date:** 2025-10-30 13:28:06

**Summary:**
Created a comprehensive guide for building static knowledge graphs for LLM chain-of-thought reasoning. This 470-line document synthesizes research findings (arXiv papers on KG representation for LLMs, industry best practices on taxonomy design) with practical lessons from building the AI Pilot Assessment Engine. The guide covers ten major topics: when to build a static KG vs. alternatives, scoping decisions (coverage, granularity, depth, audience), structuring principles (node/edge design, relationship types), taxonomy depth and abstraction consistency (with checking methods), enrichment for completeness (scales, assessment times, confidence impacts), transformation for LLM reasoning (natural language vs. JSON vs. Python pseudocode), validation methodology (4-phase approach), maintenance and evolution (version control, refactoring triggers), and a detailed case study of this project. The guide is designed to be a reusable resource for anyone building similar cross-domain knowledge graphs for decision support systems.
