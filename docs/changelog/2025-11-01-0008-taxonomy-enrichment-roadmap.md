# Taxonomy Enrichment Roadmap - Gap Analysis Complete

**Date:** 2025-11-01 00:08  
**Status:** Planning Complete  
**Priority:** Critical - Blocker for Knowledge Graph Construction

---

## Summary

Completed comprehensive gap analysis of existing taxonomies and created detailed implementation roadmap for taxonomy enrichment. Identified 6 critical gaps blocking knowledge graph construction and defined clear path to resolution.

This analysis resulted in a major shift in the project direction, leading to the Output-Centric Model and the Scope Lock.

---

## Problem Identified

Existing taxonomies (`AI_use_case_taxonomy.json`, `AI_dependency_taxonomy.json`) define **WHAT exists** (AI archetypes, technical prerequisites) but lack the **organizational context layer** needed for conversational assessment.

**Core Gap:** No structured definition of **organizational factors** - the measurable attributes of an organization that determine AI readiness.

**Impact:** Cannot build knowledge graph edges connecting:
- User conversations â†’ Factor assessments
- Factor assessments â†’ Capability evaluations  
- Capability evaluations â†’ Project feasibility

---

## Gap Analysis Results

### Critical Gaps ðŸš¨

**1. Organizational Factors Taxonomy (MISSING)**
- No structured definition of assessable organizational attributes
- No 0-100 scales with observable anchors
- No inference hints for LLM-based assessment
- **Impact:** Cannot infer "data_quality = 30" from conversation

**2. Factor-to-Capability Mapping (MISSING)**
- No definition of how factors combine to enable project types
- No factor weights or importance levels
- No minimum thresholds per capability
- **Impact:** Cannot evaluate "Can we do sales forecasting?" from assessed factors

### High Priority Gaps ðŸ”´

**3. Factor Interdependencies (MISSING)**
- No model of how factors influence each other
- Cannot represent "executive support mitigates expertise gaps"
- **Impact:** Cannot provide nuanced recommendations

**4. Prerequisite-to-Factor Mapping (INCOMPLETE)**
- Prerequisites exist in isolation
- No link to organizational factors
- **Impact:** Cannot bridge technical requirements to organizational reality

### Medium Priority Gaps ðŸŸ¡

**5. Assessment Metadata (MISSING)**
- No time-to-assess estimates
- No confidence impact calculations
- **Impact:** Cannot prioritize assessment activities with ROI

**6. Factor-to-Archetype Impact (MISSING)**
- No model of which factors improve which archetypes
- **Impact:** Cannot explain factor value or prioritize improvements

### 4. Factor Structure
**15 core factors across 3 categories:**

**Data Readiness (5):**
- data_quality, data_availability, data_governance, data_infrastructure, data_security

- ml_infrastructure, ml_expertise, ml_tooling, experimentation_culture, model_lifecycle_management

**Organizational Readiness (5):**
- executive_support, change_management, cross_functional_collaboration, risk_tolerance, business_process_maturity

### 5. Knowledge Graph Structure
**New node and edge types needed:**
```
ORGANIZATIONAL_FACTOR
  â†“ HAS_SCALE â†’ FACTOR_SCALE
  â†“ SATISFIES â†’ PREREQUISITE
  â†“ ENABLES â†’ CAPABILITY
  â†“ SUPPORTS â†’ AI_ARCHETYPE
  â†“ INFLUENCES â†’ OTHER_FACTOR
  â†“ IMPROVES â†’ AI_ARCHETYPE (with impact)
```

## Example: What's Missing

### Current State
```json
// AI_dependency_taxonomy.json
{
  "Clean_and_validated_data": {
    "description": "Data must be free from errors...",
    "dependent_models": ["Isolation Forest", "K-Means", ...]
  }
}
```

### Required State
```json
// organizational_factors.json
{
  "factor_id": "data_quality",
  "scale": {
    "anchors": {
      "0": "No quality controls, data unreliable",
      "20": "Ad-hoc checks, many known issues",
      "40": "Basic processes, some validation",
      "60": "Systematic framework, automated checks",
      "80": "Comprehensive governance",
      "100": "World-class quality, real-time monitoring"
    }
  },

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks ðŸ”´
1. **Scales Too Subjective** - LLM can't reliably infer values
   - Mitigation: Observable anchors, test with 10 excerpts
2. **Prerequisite Mappings Incomplete** - Cannot bridge technical to organizational
   - Mitigation: Systematic review of all 40+ prerequisites

### Medium Risks ðŸŸ¡
1. **Weights/Impacts Arbitrary** - Confidence scores don't match reality
   - Mitigation: Domain expert validation, test with 5 scenarios
2. **Interdependencies Too Complex** - Hard to maintain
   - Mitigation: Limit to 10-15 key relationships

### Low Risks ðŸŸ¢
1. **Time Estimates Wrong** - ROI suggestions misleading
   - Mitigation: Provide ranges, iterate based on feedback

## Estimated Timeline

**Minimum Viable (Phases 1-2):** 2-3 days  
**Recommended (Phases 1-4):** 4-5 days  
**Complete (All phases):** 5-6 days

**Critical Path:** Phases 1-2 unblock Epic 1 implementation

---

## Conclusion

Comprehensive gap analysis complete. Clear path forward defined. Ready to proceed with taxonomy enrichment.

**Key Takeaway:** The existing taxonomies are structurally sound but lack the organizational factor layer needed to connect technical AI capabilities to organizational reality. Adding this layer (Phases 1-4) will enable the full conversational assessment system.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Phases 1-2 immediately (2-3 days) to unblock Epic 1, then continue with Phases 3-4 (2 days) for complete foundation.

**Status:** Planning Complete, Ready for Execution  
**Blocker Status:** Identified and Roadmap Created  
**Next Step:** Review and begin Phase 1 (Core Factor Definition)
