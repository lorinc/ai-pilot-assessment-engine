# Taxonomy Enrichment Roadmap - Knowledge Graph Readiness

**Date:** 2024-11-01  
**Status:** Planning  
**Priority:** Critical - Blocker for Knowledge Graph Construction  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 days

---

## Executive Summary

The existing taxonomies (`AI_use_case_taxonomy.json`, `AI_dependency_taxonomy.json`) define **WHAT exists** (AI archetypes, technical prerequisites) but lack the **organizational context layer** needed to build a functional knowledge graph for conversational assessment.

**Core Gap:** No structured definition of **organizational factors** - the measurable attributes of an organization that determine AI readiness.

**Impact:** Cannot build knowledge graph edges that connect:
- User conversations ‚Üí Factor assessments ‚Üí Capability evaluations ‚Üí Project feasibility

---

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have ‚úÖ

**1. AI Use Case Taxonomy** (`AI_use_case_taxonomy.json`)
- 25 AI archetypes (Anomaly Detection, Classification, Forecasting, etc.)
- Technical families and analytical purposes
- Example outputs and models
- **Status:** Structurally complete

**2. AI Dependency Taxonomy** (`AI_dependency_taxonomy.json`)
- 7 prerequisite categories (Data Quality, Technical Expertise, Infrastructure, etc.)
- 40+ specific prerequisites with descriptions
- Links to dependent models and outputs
- **Status:** Structurally complete but isolated

**3. Scoped Factor Model** (Documentation)
- Architecture for domain/system-specific assessments
- Scope matching algorithm implemented
- Clarifying question patterns defined
- **Status:** Design complete, awaiting data foundation

### What's Missing ‚ùå

**1. Organizational Factors Taxonomy** üö® CRITICAL
- No structured definition of assessable organizational attributes
- No 0-100 scales with observable anchors
- No inference hints for LLM-based assessment
- **Impact:** Cannot infer "data_quality = 30" from conversation

**2. Factor-to-Capability Mapping** üö® CRITICAL
- No definition of how factors combine to enable project types
- No factor weights or importance levels
- No minimum thresholds per capability
- **Impact:** Cannot evaluate "Can we do sales forecasting?" from assessed factors

**3. Factor Interdependencies** üî¥ HIGH
- No model of how factors influence each other
- Cannot represent "executive support mitigates expertise gaps"
- No mechanism for factor-based reasoning
- **Impact:** Cannot provide nuanced recommendations

**4. Prerequisite-to-Factor Mapping** üî¥ HIGH
- Prerequisites exist in isolation
- No link to organizational factors
- Cannot determine "Is 'Clean_and_validated_data' satisfied?"
- **Impact:** Cannot bridge technical requirements to organizational reality

**5. Assessment Metadata** üü° MEDIUM
- No time-to-assess estimates
- No confidence impact calculations
- No ROI data for "what's next" suggestions
- **Impact:** Cannot prioritize assessment activities

**6. Factor-to-Archetype Impact** üü° MEDIUM
- No model of which factors improve which archetypes
- Cannot answer "Improving data governance helps which projects?"
- No quantified impact relationships
- **Impact:** Cannot explain factor value or prioritize improvements

---

## Gap Analysis: Why This Blocks Knowledge Graph Construction

### Current Taxonomy Structure
```
AI_use_case_taxonomy.json:
  Archetype ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Outputs

AI_dependency_taxonomy.json:
  Prerequisite ‚Üí Dependent Models ‚Üí Dependent Outputs
```

### Required Knowledge Graph Structure
```
ORGANIZATIONAL_FACTOR (e.g., data_quality)
  ‚Üì HAS_SCALE
  FACTOR_SCALE (0-100 with anchors)
  
  ‚Üì SATISFIES
  PREREQUISITE (e.g., Clean_and_validated_data)
  
  ‚Üì ENABLES
  CAPABILITY (e.g., Supervised Classification)
  
  ‚Üì SUPPORTS
  AI_ARCHETYPE (e.g., Classification)
  
  ‚Üì INFLUENCES
  OTHER_FACTOR (e.g., data_governance ‚Üí data_quality)
  
  ‚Üì IMPROVES
  AI_ARCHETYPE (with impact score)
```

### Missing Edges
Without organizational factors, we cannot create:
1. **Conversation ‚Üí Factor** edges (no scales to map statements to values)
2. **Factor ‚Üí Prerequisite** edges (no mapping defined)
3. **Factor ‚Üí Capability** edges (no capability definitions)
4. **Factor ‚Üí Factor** edges (no interdependencies)
5. **Factor ‚Üí Archetype** edges (no impact model)

**Result:** Knowledge graph has archetypes and prerequisites, but no way to connect them to organizational reality.

## Detailed Gap Breakdown

### Gap 1: Organizational Factors Taxonomy üö®

**What's Missing:**
```json
{
  "factor_id": "data_quality",
  "factor_name": "Data Quality",
  "category": "data_readiness",
  "description": "Quality, consistency, and reliability of organizational data",
  
  "scale": {
    "type": "0-100",
    "anchors": {
      "0": "No quality controls, data unreliable for any use",
      "20": "Ad-hoc quality checks, many known issues, manual fixes",
      "40": "Basic quality processes, some validation, reactive fixes",
      "60": "Systematic quality framework, automated checks, proactive monitoring",
      "80": "Comprehensive quality governance, continuous improvement",
      "100": "World-class data quality, real-time monitoring, zero tolerance"
    }
  },
  
  "scope_dimensions": {
    "domain": {"required": false, "common_values": ["sales", "finance", "operations"]},
    "system": {"required": false, "allow_custom": true},
    "team": {"required": false, "allow_custom": true}
  },
  
  "inference_hints": {
    "positive_indicators": ["automated validation", "data quality dashboard", "quality SLAs"],
    "negative_indicators": ["scattered data", "no data catalog", "frequent duplicates"]
  },
  
  "assessment_metadata": {
    "typical_time_minutes": 10,
    "complexity": "medium",
    "requires_technical_knowledge": false
  }
}
```

**Why Critical:**
- LLM needs scales to map "data scattered across 5 systems" ‚Üí `data_quality = 20`
- Scope dimensions enable domain/system-specific assessments
- Inference hints guide conversational extraction
- Assessment metadata enables ROI calculations

**Minimum Required Factors (15):**

**Data Readiness (5):**
1. `data_quality` - Quality, consistency, reliability
2. `data_availability` - Volume, coverage, accessibility
3. `data_governance` - Policies, ownership, compliance
4. `data_infrastructure` - Storage, processing, pipelines
5. `data_security` - Access controls, privacy, encryption

**AI Capability (5):**
6. `ml_infrastructure` - Compute, MLOps, deployment
7. `ml_expertise` - Team skills, experience, training
8. `ml_tooling` - Frameworks, platforms, monitoring
9. `experimentation_culture` - Testing, iteration, learning
10. `model_lifecycle_management` - Versioning, monitoring, retraining

**Organizational Readiness (5):**
11. `executive_support` - CxO buy-in, budget, priority
12. `change_management` - Adoption processes, training, communication
13. `cross_functional_collaboration` - Data science + business alignment
14. `risk_tolerance` - Willingness to experiment, fail fast
15. `business_process_maturity` - Documented, measured, optimized

### Gap 2: Factor-to-Capability Mapping üö®

**What's Missing:**
```json
{
  "capability_id": "supervised_classification",
  "capability_name": "Supervised Classification Projects",
  "description": "Ability to build and deploy classification models",
  
  "enabled_archetypes": [
    "Content Analysis / Labeling / Evaluation",
    "Classification",
    "Intent Detection & Routing"
  ],
  
  "factor_requirements": [
    {
      "factor_id": "data_quality",
      "importance": "critical",
      "minimum_threshold": 50,
      "weight": 0.25,
      "rationale": "Classification requires clean, consistent labeled data"
    },
    {
      "factor_id": "data_availability",
      "importance": "critical",
      "minimum_threshold": 60,
      "weight": 0.20,
      "rationale": "Need sufficient labeled examples for training"
    },
    {
      "factor_id": "ml_expertise",
      "importance": "important",
      "minimum_threshold": 40,
      "weight": 0.15,
      "rationale": "Classification is well-understood, moderate expertise sufficient"
    }
  ],
  
  "confidence_calculation": {
    "formula": "weighted_average",
    "minimum_confidence_threshold": 0.60
  }
}
```

**Why Critical:**
- Enables project feasibility evaluation: "Can we do sales forecasting?"
- Provides confidence scoring: "45% confident based on assessed factors"
- Identifies gaps: "Need data_governance (10 min) ‚Üí +15% confidence"
- Links factors to actionable project types

**Minimum Required Capabilities (6):**
1. Supervised Classification
2. Regression & Forecasting
3. Anomaly Detection
4. Clustering & Segmentation
5. Natural Language Processing
6. Generative AI

### Gap 3: Factor Interdependencies üî¥

**What's Missing:**
```json
{
  "source_factor": "executive_support",

  "relationship_type": "mitigates_gap",
  "strength": 0.30,
  "description": "Strong executive support can compensate for expertise gaps",
  "mechanism": "budget_for_training",
  "examples": [
    "CxO approves 6-month learning period",
    "Budget for external consultants",
    "Protected time for experimentation"
  ]
}
```

**Relationship Types:**
- `mitigates_gap` - Source compensates for weakness in target
- `enables` - Source is prerequisite for target
- `reinforces` - Source amplifies target
- `conflicts_with` - Source undermines target

**Why Important:**
- Enables nuanced reasoning: "Low ML expertise, but high executive support ‚Üí viable with training"
- Explains factor interactions in recommendations
- Supports "what-if" scenarios: "If we improve governance, quality will improve"

**Minimum Required Interdependencies (10-15):**
- executive_support ‚Üí ml_expertise (mitigates)
- data_governance ‚Üí data_quality (enables)
- experimentation_culture ‚Üí risk_tolerance (reinforces)
- ml_infrastructure ‚Üí model_lifecycle_management (enables)
- cross_functional_collaboration ‚Üí change_management (reinforces)

- risk_tolerance ‚Üí experimentation_culture (reinforces)
- executive_support ‚Üí cross_functional_collaboration (enables)

### Gap 4: Prerequisite-to-Factor Mapping üî¥

**What's Missing:**
```json
// In AI_dependency_taxonomy.json, add to each prerequisite:
{
  "prerequisite_id": "Clean_and_validated_data",
  "description": "...",
  "dependent_models": [...],
  
  "maps_to_factors": [
    {
      "factor_id": "data_quality",
      "contribution": "primary",

    },
    {
      "factor_id": "data_infrastructure",
      "contribution": "supporting",
      "threshold": 40,
      "notes": "Infrastructure needed to implement quality checks"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why Important:**
- Bridges technical requirements to organizational factors
- Enables prerequisite satisfaction checking
- Links existing taxonomy to new factor model
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Scope:** Update all 40+ prerequisites in `AI_dependency_taxonomy.json`

### Gap 5: Assessment Metadata üü°

**What's Missing:**
```json
{
  "factor_id": "data_quality",
  "typical_assessment_time_minutes": 10,

    "regression_forecasting": 0.18,
    "anomaly_detection": 0.12
  },
  "assessment_difficulty": "medium",
  "requires_technical_expert": false,
  "can_be_partially_assessed": true,
  "diminishing_returns_threshold": 3
}
```

**Why Useful:**
- Enables ROI-driven "what's next" suggestions
- Prioritizes assessment activities by impact/time
- Signals diminishing returns: "After 3 turns, <5% confidence gain"
- Supports Pareto principle: "20% of factors, 80% of value"

### Gap 6: Factor-to-Archetype Impact üü°

**What's Missing:**
```json
{
  "factor_id": "data_quality",
  "improves_archetypes": [
    {
      "archetype": "Classification",
      "impact_score": 0.85,
      "mechanism": "Better data quality directly improves classification accuracy",
      "typical_improvement": "10-30% accuracy gain"
    },
    {
      "archetype": "Regression & Forecasting",
      "impact_score": 0.90,
      "mechanism": "Clean data reduces noise in predictions",
      "typical_improvement": "15-40% error reduction"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why Useful:**
- Answers: "Improving data governance helps which projects?"
- Quantifies factor value: "data_quality has 0.85 impact on classification"
- Prioritizes improvement efforts
- Explains why factors matter

## Next Steps After Completion

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Update knowledge graph builder to load new taxonomies
2. Create validation test suite
3. Update LLM prompts to use factor scales
4. Begin Epic 1 implementation with `data_quality` factor

### Short-term (Week 2-3)
1. Expand to all 15 factors in Epic 2
2. Implement project feasibility evaluation (Epic 3)
3. Build "what's next" suggestion engine (Epic 4)
4. Test with real users, iterate based on feedback

### Long-term (Month 2-3)
1. Add more factors based on usage patterns (expand to 20-25)
2. Refine weights and impacts based on real data
3. Add more capabilities (expand to 10-12)
4. Build factor improvement recommendation engine

---

## Open Questions

1. **Scope:** 15 factors sufficient for MVP, or need 20-25?
   - **Recommendation:** Start with 15, expand based on usage data

2. **Granularity:** Should factors have sub-factors, or keep flat?
   - **Recommendation:** Keep flat for MVP, consider hierarchy in v2

3. **Interdependencies:** Model as graph edges, or separate file?
   - **Recommendation:** Separate file for maintainability, load as edges in graph

4. **Validation:** Need automated tests, or manual review sufficient?
   - **Recommendation:** Both - automated for structure, manual for semantics

5. **Maintenance:** Who owns taxonomy updates after initial creation?
   - **Recommendation:** Define ownership and update process in Phase 6

6. **Versioning:** How to handle taxonomy evolution over time?
   - **Recommendation:** Semantic versioning, migration scripts for breaking changes

---

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear, prioritized path to complete the taxonomy foundation needed for knowledge graph construction. The 6-phase approach balances critical needs (Phases 1-2) with important enhancements (Phases 3-4) and useful optimizations (Phases 5-6).

**Critical Path:** Phases 1-2 (Factor Definition + Capability Mapping) are sufficient to unblock Epic 1 and begin implementation.

**Estimated Timeline:**
- **Minimum Viable:** 2-3 days (Phases 1-2)
- **Recommended:** 4-5 days (Phases 1-4)
- **Complete:** 5-6 days (All phases)

**Next Action:** Review this roadmap, confirm scope and priorities, then proceed with Phase 1 (Core Factor Definition).
