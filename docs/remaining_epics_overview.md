## Open Questions for Future Epics

1. **Epic 03:** Should the agent support parallel tool execution or strictly sequential?
2. **Epic 05:** Do we need streaming responses or is batch response acceptable?
3. **Epic 08:** Should we implement auto-scaling or keep concurrency=1?
4. **Epic 09:** How long should sessions persist? (30 days? 90 days?)
5. **Epic 11:** PDF export - is this required or nice-to-have?
6. **Epic 12:** At what graph size do we need to migrate to Neo4j?
7. **Epic 13:** Should knowledge updates require approval workflow?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Epic 01** (Knowledge Graph Foundation)
2. **Review and refine Epic 02** (Test Data) based on Epic 01 learnings
3. **Spike on LangChain + Vertex AI integration** before Epic 03
4. **Early deployment experiment** (Epic 08 spike) after Epic 05 to validate cloud setup
