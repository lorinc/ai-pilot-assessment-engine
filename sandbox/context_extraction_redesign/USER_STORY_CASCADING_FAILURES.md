# User Story: Cascading Failures Across Marketing, Sales, and Production Planning

---

Look, I'll try to explain what's happening here, but honestly, it's a mess and I'm not even sure where to start. We have this whole chain of forecasts and plans that flow from marketing through sales to production planning, and somewhere along the way everything gets distorted, but nobody can tell me exactly where or why.

So it starts with marketing. They create these campaign performance forecasts in HubSpot - you know, expected leads per campaign, conversion estimates, that kind of thing. The problem is, their forecasts are based on historical data that's scattered across three different tools. Some of it lives in HubSpot, some in Google Analytics, and some in this old Excel dashboard that nobody maintains anymore. The marketing team pulls numbers from wherever they can find them, but there's no single source of truth. Half the time they're working with stale data because nobody updates the Excel file, and the Google Analytics integration keeps breaking. So their campaign forecasts are already questionable before they even hand them off.

Then sales takes those marketing forecasts and uses them to build their pipeline projections in Salesforce. But here's the thing - sales doesn't trust marketing's numbers. They've been burned before by overly optimistic projections, so they apply their own "gut feel" adjustments. Different sales managers adjust differently - some cut the numbers by 20%, others by 40%, there's no consistent process. These adjusted pipeline forecasts go into Salesforce, but the sales team is terrible about keeping Salesforce updated. They're always in meetings, always closing deals, and data entry is the last thing on their minds. So the pipeline data in Salesforce is perpetually out of date, sometimes by weeks.

Now production planning takes those sales pipeline forecasts from Salesforce and feeds them into their production scheduling spreadsheet. Yes, a spreadsheet - we don't have a proper production planning system. The production planning team manually exports data from Salesforce every Monday morning, copies it into their master Excel file, and uses that to generate production orders for the next month. But because the Salesforce data is already stale, and because there's a manual export process that sometimes gets delayed, the production forecasts are based on information that's often three to four weeks old.

Here's where it gets really painful. Production planning creates these manufacturing orders based on their forecasts, and those orders go to the factory floor. But nobody tracks which marketing campaign led to which sales pipeline entry, which led to which production order. The connections are completely lost. So when we end up overproducing - which we do, constantly - we have no idea whether it was because marketing over-forecasted, sales over-adjusted, production planning added their own safety buffer, or some combination of all three.

And we definitely overproduce. Our warehouses are full of inventory we can't move. But when I ask "where did this forecast error come from?", nobody can tell me. Marketing says their forecasts were fine. Sales says they adjusted conservatively. Production planning says they just used what sales gave them. Everyone's pointing fingers, but there's no data trail to follow back to the source of the error.

The worst part is the compounding effect. When marketing's forecast is off by 10%, sales might adjust it in the wrong direction and make it 15% off, then production planning adds their safety buffer and now we're 25% off. But we don't see these incremental distortions - we only see the final result, which is a warehouse full of products we can't sell.

And it's not like we can just fix one piece of this. The marketing team needs better data integration, but they're understaffed and don't have time to clean up their data sources. The sales team needs to update Salesforce more consistently, but they're measured on closed deals, not data quality, so why would they prioritize it? Production planning needs a real system instead of Excel, but that's a six-month IT project and we don't have the budget.

So we're stuck in this situation where everything kinda works - we do produce products, we do sell them, the business runs - but it's incredibly inefficient and we have no visibility into what's actually driving our results. We can't tell which marketing campaigns are truly effective because the data is too messy. We can't tell which sales adjustments are smart and which are paranoid because there's no feedback loop. We can't optimize production because we don't know which forecasts to trust.

I've tried to map this out, to understand the flow, but it's like trying to untangle a ball of yarn. Marketing's campaign forecasts affect sales pipeline projections, which affect production orders, which affect inventory levels. But there are also informal processes - sales managers calling production planning directly to rush orders, marketing running campaigns that never make it into the forecast, production planning holding back capacity "just in case". None of this is documented, none of this is tracked.

What I really need is to understand the whole system - not just the outputs, but how each team's work affects the next team's inputs, how each tool's limitations create workarounds, how each informal process introduces errors. Because right now, we're flying blind. We know we're overproducing, we know we're overstocked, but we don't know where to intervene to fix it. Do we need better marketing data? Better sales discipline? Better production planning tools? All of the above? I honestly don't know, and that's what's keeping me up at night.
