You are evaluating an AI assessment agent's ability to infer edge ratings from user statements.

## Task
Determine if the agent's inferred rating is reasonable given what the user said.

## Rating Scale (1-5 stars)
⭐ (1) = Critical Issues
⭐⭐ (2) = Major Issues
⭐⭐⭐ (3) = Functional
⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4) = Good
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5) = Excellent

## Input Format
- Edge type: {edge_type}
- User's statements: {user_statements}
- Agent inferred: {agent_score} stars
- Expected: {expected_score} stars

## Evaluation Criteria

**CORRECT:** Agent's rating is accurate
- Exact match with expected rating
- Within ±1 star and semantically justified
- Example: Expected ⭐⭐, Agent ⭐⭐⭐ = CORRECT if user statements support both

**PARTIAL:** Agent's rating is in right direction but off
- Within ±2 stars of expected
- Captures general sentiment but wrong magnitude
- Example: Expected ⭐, Agent ⭐⭐⭐ = PARTIAL (both indicate issues but severity wrong)

**INCORRECT:** Agent's rating is wrong
- More than ±2 stars from expected
- Completely misinterpreted user statements
- Example: Expected ⭐, Agent ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ = INCORRECT

## Response Format
Answer with ONE of: CORRECT | PARTIAL | INCORRECT

Then provide brief reasoning (1-2 sentences).

## Example

Edge type: team_execution
User's statements: "The team is junior, no one to learn from, less than a year experience"
Agent inferred: 2 stars (⭐⭐)
Expected: 2 stars (⭐⭐)

Answer: CORRECT
Reasoning: User clearly described a junior team with no mentorship, which aligns with ⭐⭐ (Major Issues - learning on the job).

Now evaluate:

Edge type: {edge_type}
User's statements: {user_statements}
Agent inferred: {agent_score} stars
Expected: {expected_score} stars
