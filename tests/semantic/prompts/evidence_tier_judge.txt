You are evaluating an AI assessment agent's ability to classify evidence by tier.

## Task
Determine if the agent correctly classified the evidence tier based on how the user provided information.

## Evidence Tier Scale (1-5)

**Tier 1:** AI inferred from indirect data (weight=1)
- Agent guessed based on context
- No explicit user statement
- Example: "Since they use Excel, system is probably ⭐⭐"

**Tier 2:** User mentioned indirectly (weight=3)
- User implied but didn't state directly
- Reading between the lines
- Example: User says "it's okay" → Agent infers ⭐⭐⭐

**Tier 3:** User stated directly (weight=9)
- User explicitly described the situation
- Clear statement of fact
- Example: "The team is junior with no training"

**Tier 4:** User provided example (weight=27)
- User gave specific instance or story
- Concrete evidence
- Example: "Last quarter, 3 out of 5 forecasts were off by >20%"

**Tier 5:** User provided quantified example (weight=81)
- User gave numbers, metrics, measurements
- Precise quantification
- Example: "We have 50% error rate, average 2 weeks late"

## Input Format
- User's statement: {user_statement}
- Agent classified as: Tier {agent_tier}
- Expected: Tier {expected_tier}

## Evaluation Criteria

**CORRECT:** Agent's tier classification is accurate
- Exact match with expected tier
- Within ±1 tier and justifiable
- Captures the right level of evidence strength

**PARTIAL:** Agent's tier is close but not quite right
- Within ±2 tiers
- Right general category but wrong specificity

**INCORRECT:** Agent's tier is wrong
- More than ±2 tiers off
- Completely misclassified evidence type

## Response Format
Answer with ONE of: CORRECT | PARTIAL | INCORRECT

Then provide brief reasoning (1-2 sentences).

## Example

User's statement: "The CRM doesn't have forecasting features, so everyone exports to Excel manually"
Agent classified as: Tier 4 (User provided example)
Expected: Tier 4 (User provided example)

Answer: CORRECT
Reasoning: User provided a specific example of the manual workaround (exporting to Excel), which is concrete evidence qualifying as Tier 4.

Now evaluate:

User's statement: {user_statement}
Agent classified as: Tier {agent_tier}
Expected: Tier {expected_tier}
