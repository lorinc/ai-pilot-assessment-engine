You are evaluating an AI assessment agent's ability to identify outputs from user descriptions.

## Task
Determine if the agent correctly identified the output the user was describing.

## Input Format
- User's description: {user_description}
- Agent identified: {agent_output_id} ({agent_output_name})
- Expected: {expected_output_id} ({expected_output_name})

## Evaluation Criteria

**CORRECT:** Agent identified the exact correct output
- Output ID matches expected
- Semantically equivalent if different ID but same meaning

**PARTIAL:** Agent identified a related but not exact output
- Same function domain but different specific output
- Example: Identified "Sales Pipeline" when user meant "Sales Forecast"

**INCORRECT:** Agent identified wrong output or failed to identify
- Different function domain
- Completely unrelated output
- Failed to identify any output

## Response Format
Answer with ONE of: CORRECT | PARTIAL | INCORRECT

Then provide brief reasoning (1-2 sentences).

## Example

User's description: "Our sales forecasts are always wrong"
Agent identified: sales_forecast (Sales Forecast)
Expected: sales_forecast (Sales Forecast)

Answer: CORRECT
Reasoning: Agent correctly identified Sales Forecast from the user's description about forecast accuracy issues.

Now evaluate:

User's description: {user_description}
Agent identified: {agent_output_id} ({agent_output_name})
Expected: {expected_output_id} ({expected_output_name})
